						<div id="msgcontent">

							<p>For almost 10 years, President Mimura has done his utmost to raise the company, from a design company with less
							than 100 employees until it became a leading engineering firm in the Philippines with about 500 employees. To take
							over President Mimura's position is indeed a challenging job.</p>

							<p>I aim to advance the existing management policies and stance. As explained by President Mimura, the final target                     of DASH is to accomplish the following:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>To become EPC Engineering Firm</li>
							<li>To become the No. 1 Engineering Firm in the Philippines</li>
							<li>To have the same level of skill and the same salary base as MES.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>As you all know, the Lehman Shock that occurred in 2008 had created severe impact to many industries and had
							made negative effect in our businesses of Plant, Shipbuilding and Advanced Machineries, and unfortunately this
							severe business climate still continues.</p>

							<p>Despite of this economic condition, we must move forward and take this time to solve the problem of decreasing
							workload. If we do not face the problems nor challenge ourselves, then there is no way for us to survive in this
							harsh society. It is DASH Management Personnel like me who will establish the basic policies, but it is YOU who
							will execute these policies.</p>

							<p>Over the time, DASH has grown from being a Low-Cost Engineering Center (LCEC) into being the Center for 3D
							Design. Now DASH has become an indispensable part of MES.
							</p>

							<p>The basic mission of DASH, "Give maximum support for MES to give out the best advantage as DASH grows together
							with MES", has not changed since the establishment of DASH and will never change in the future.
							</p>

							<p>Tonight, I want to talk about the basic work policies point by point.</p>

							<p>1. Strict Compliance of Objectives and Promises</p>

							<p>Keep your promises, follow schedules, and accomplish the posted target until the end without giving up. Do not
							think of impossibilities, but rather focus to solve problems by all means. Think and act optimistically.
							</p>

							<p>2. Conduct Open and Active Communication</p>

							<p>Always keep in mind to further enhance communication within DASH and with MES. Each and every department must
							take a course of action that takes into account the whole DASH and MES community.
							</p>

							<p>3. Improvements, Reform, and BPS Promotion</p>

							<p>BPS is 'a work itself' and should be promoted to all members. To make this point clear, it must be understood
							that 'a work itself' means "a work to improve and reform the daily work".
							</p>

							<p>Moreover, consider changing current work procedure for improvement in your work if you are not satisfied with
							the present one. Do not make your past successes and previous experiences interfere with the progress of this
							activity. <br>
							Your determination to attain reform and improvement will lead to business continuity. If we conduct this activity
							honestly, including the smallest matter, we can gain trust. </p>

							<p>4. After Customer Satisfaction, then Employee Satisfaction will follow</p>

							<p>The work we are doing within DASH is mainly design work seen in PC displays or inscribed in paper. Complete
							customer satisfaction is attainable neither on PC nor on paper. It is gained when material procurement, production, 					and site construction have accomplished everything according to the requirements set and ordered; when project is
							completed as scheduled without any delays; and when the completed project has the required capacity and
							specification that can satisfy what was ordered. Customer satisfaction gained in the process is also an added
							advantage for the company's image.
							</p>

							<p>5. Observe proper compliance of societal rules and laws.</p>

							<p>We have to have pride as global engineering firm.</p>

							<p>6. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</p>

							<p>DASH has already been conducting various CSR activities. DASH, as a company and all its members, has responded
							to environmental issues and call for contributions to the community. I encourage the continuation of this noble
							activity.</p>

							<p>These are my basic work policies.</p>

							<p>If all DASH members loyally perform and follow the 6 points that I have mentioned, I believe we can definitely
							overcome any situation no matter how severe they may be. As a result of such perseverance, I believe that DASH will 					become a fully able company.</p>

							<p>The company philosophy of MES, "To continue working as a company trusted by Society and individual through
							products and services we offer", shall be fully realized. </p>

							<p>For these endeavors, I will do my best, with your cooperation, members of DASH and MES.</p>
