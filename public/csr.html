						<p>The firm conviction that Corporate Social Responsibility must be ingrained in one's life is the foundation of a
						solid commitment to holistic sustainability. DASH Engineering Philippines Inc. does business with this conviction.</p>

						<p>In all our corporate decisions, we essentially honor the triple bottom line: People, Planet and Profit.</p>

						<span class="bold">Our People</span>

						<p>Our team members are the very core of CSR. To augment these principles, we invest much on our Occupational Safety
						and Health Committee (OSHC) through our medical and sports programs making everyone healthy, capable, and
						well-equipped.</p>

						<p>We also recognize the cooperation, inquisitiveness, kindness and passion of the Filipino people as a potent force
						for change and progress.</p>

						<span class="bold">Our Planet</span>

						<p>The Company always does its share to address concerns that affect us globally. Together with our clients, we always
						try cost-efficient means to minimize CO2 emissions as an answer to the ill effects of global warming.</p>

						<span class="bold">Our Profit</span>

						<p>We believe that a personal accountability to all stakeholders must be considered in every activity. We take all
						responsibility for the effects our business has with the community. With that, the inclusion of public interest is
						always considered in our corporate decision-making.</p>
